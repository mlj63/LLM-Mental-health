# LLM-Mental-health
This is my senior thesis designing an LLM to help diagnose depression and anxeity
I envision utilizng a LLM chatbot that can reduce the burden on mental healthcare providers and aid both patients and healthcare facilities by reducing screening visits to the hospital. Notably, the outputs of the chatbot will not take the place of expertise of providers but will instead be utilized to augment productivity of providers and patients alike due to their robust capability to process and interpret vast amounts of unstructured medical data. Thank you to all who have contributed and helped me with this project.
